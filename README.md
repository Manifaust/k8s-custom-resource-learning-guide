This repo contains the notes and observation I took as I was learned about k8s custom resources and controllers. Keeping these notes helped me stay organized as I was reading and completing tutorials in spurts, and I hope it can help others do the same. Also, I noticed that since k8s is evolving so quickly, online example tend to have some out of date elements. I've added comments to help people avoid these and other pitfalls.

Notes are organized into sections, starting with [Prerequisites](00_prerequisites.md).
